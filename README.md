# Ultra Potato

An Obsidian theme built on the foundation of the gorgeous [Ultra Lobster](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster) by **kneecaps** (shiva).

## About

Ultra Potato is a continuation of the Ultra Lobster theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). The original Ultra Lobster was an ambitious theme combining multiple sub-themes, extensive color schemes, and deep customization via the Style Settings plugin. Ultra Potato carries that vision forward with a modernized, modular architecture designed for long-term maintainability and development.

- 40+ color schemes (light and dark)
- 8 accent color options
- Multiple callout styles (gummy, brutal, soft, line, and more)
- Canvas node theming with gradient options
- Multiple codeblock styles
- Extensive typography options
- Style Settings integration for deep customization
